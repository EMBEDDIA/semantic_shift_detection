## Installation, documentation ##

Published results were produced in Python 3 programming environment on Linux Mint 18 Cinnamon operating system. Instructions for installation assume the usage of PyPI package manager.<br/>
Clone the project from the repository with 'git clone https://gitlab.com/matej.martinc/semantic_shift_detection'<br/>
Install dependencies if needed: pip install -r requirements.txt

### To reproduce the results on the LiverpoolFC corpus published in the paper run the code in the command line using following commands: ###

Generate time specific representation for each word using the already fine-tuned model:<br/>
python get_embeddings.py

Visualize everything and calculate Pearson correlation:<br/>
python visualize.py

To fine-tune custom BERT model on the corpus<br/>
python fine_tuning.py
